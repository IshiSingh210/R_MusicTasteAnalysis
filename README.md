# R_MusicTasteAnalysis
Music therapy, or MT, is the use of music to improve an individual's stress, mood, and overall mental health. MT is also recognized as an  evidence-based practice, using music as a catalyst for "happy" hormones such as oxytocin.
The MxMH dataset aims to identify what, if any, correlations exist between an individual's music taste and their self-reported mental health. Ideally, these findings could contribute to a more informed application of MT or simply provide interesting sights about the mind

1. Specific Questions:
● Can an individual's music taste serve as a predictor of their mental health status?
● Are there specific genres or types of music associated with better or worse mental health outcomes?
● How accurately can we predict mental health indicators (e.g., depression, anxiety) based on music preferences?
2. Success Criteria:
● Developing a predictive model with high accuracy in classifying mental health status.
● Identifying significant correlations or patterns between music genres and mental health outcomes
